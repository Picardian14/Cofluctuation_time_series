# Cofluctuation_time_series
Python implementation of https://github.com/brain-networks/edge-ts. It uses dummy data that represents fMRI BOLD activity of a brain parcellation, and transforms it into a co-fluctuation time series. It then calculates their RSS (root sum square) time series to select the high and low aplitude frames.
